# mitid-push

A small Chrome Extension that monitors when MitID is waiting for you to approve a login, then uses [ntfy.sh](https://ntfy.sh/) to send a notification to your phone for easier approvals.

Tested on iOS only for now.

## Installing

1. Check if your `Node.js` version is >= **14**.
2. Change or configurate the name of your extension on `src/manifest`.
3. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

## Developing

run the command

```shell
$ cd mitid-push

$ npm run dev
```

### Chrome Extension Developer Mode

1. set your Chrome browser 'Developer mode' up
2. click 'Load unpacked', and select `mitid-push/build` folder

### Nomal FrontEnd Developer Mode

1. access `http://localhost:3000/`
2. when debugging popup page, open `/popup.html`
3. when debugging options page, open `/options.html`

## Packing

After the development of your extension run the command

```shell
$ npm build
```

Now, the content of `build` folder will be the extension ready to be submitted to the Chrome Web Store. Just take a look at the [official guide](https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/publish) to more infos about publishing.
